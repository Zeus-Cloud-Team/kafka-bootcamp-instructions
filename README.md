# Zeus Cloud Team 
## Kafka Bootcamp 2017
---
### 1. Preparing for the bootcamp
The bootcamp will start off with an introductory talk about Kafka which will describe the 4 scenarios included in the bootcamp and then launch into a session of hands on development.  People will be asked to form 4 - 6 person groups.  Groups can collaborate and work on the scenarios together.  

#### Environment
The bootcamp will be done on your personal laptop, connecting to an instance of Confluent Cloud (Apache Kafka hosted on AWS).  There is starter code to get you going.  The starter code is a [starter producer](https://github.com/Zeus-Cloud-Team/kafka-producer-starter), [starter consumer](https://github.com/Zeus-Cloud-Team/kafka-consumer-starter) and [instructions to set up the Confluent Cloud CLI tool](https://github.com/Zeus-Cloud-Team/confluent-cloud-cli) for administering your topics on Confluent Cloud (called ccloud cli).
